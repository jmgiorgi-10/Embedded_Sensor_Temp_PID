Controlling temperature of MAX31889 sensor with a PWM current output from a LabJack U3 DAQ, and a FT232H ic for temperature readings through serial communication (I2C).  

Progress:
- Debugging validity of i2c communication
- PID class implemented
- PWM class implemented
- Temperature reading implemented
